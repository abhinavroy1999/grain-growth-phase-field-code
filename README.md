# Phase-field code for Grain Growth in 2D 
- Phase field code in MATLAB to solve the 2D phase field model developed by Fan &amp; Chen for Grain Growth phenomena (model with 10 order parameters for ten different grain orientations).
- The executable code is in the form of a MATLAB function file. For more information on executing the code, type 'help GrainGrowth' from the command line on MATLAB (the file must be saved in the current working directory).  
- The code is distributed under GNU GPLv3.0
- For more information on the phase-field model, read the paper which can be accessed through the link: http://www.mmm.psu.edu/DNFan1997Actamater_Graingrowth1phase2D.pdf
